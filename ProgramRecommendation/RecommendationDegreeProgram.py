# 1. Jaccard Similarityï¼š we use this method to measure the similarity of different Programs
'''
Notice that there are still some problems remain unsolved:
1. The number of subject in each program are not the same, while some programs only have a few subjects, others may have 30 subjects.
2. I think the courses seperated in the file are too detailed, and some courses may share the same objective.

# 2. Walk trap: we use this method to measure the similarity of students. Notice that it's not the real walk trap algorithm but it shares the same opinion.
# In this algorithm, we will have to set up some parameters: the steps of walk(When doing social network, usually 4 or 5 steps will be enough).
# We will also have to decide the weights of connecting each subject, which will mean the probability of choosing the subject to study.
